I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Northwestern University (USA). I hold a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. My research focuses on modeling travel behavior and demand, understanding inter- and intra-personal dynamics that shape our use of the urban environment, designing sustainable mobility and urban systems, and developing interdisciplinary methods between mathematical modeling, transport engineering, and urban social science.

I have developed [OASIS](https://github.com/transp-or/oasis), an open-source optimization-based activity-based model to simulate daily activity-travel schedules.
